# Templates, Installed Components, Tables, And Accessibility

The filename is retained for compatibility with existing skill links. NG-ZORRO-specific clauses and snippets below apply only when the affected application actually installs and uses NG-ZORRO. ASRS uses Angular Material/CDK; select its equivalent where the feature uses Material, and preserve an established semantic HTML pattern where that is canonical.

Read [dependency-catalog.md](dependency-catalog.md) before selecting or changing UI packages. Read [table-standard.md](table-standard.md) completely whenever a collection might have row-column semantics.

## Library-First Mapping

Before writing markup, map each requested interaction to the component library or established shared wrapper installed and used by the affected feature.

- `MUST-REVIEW`: when the installed library or a shared wrapper provides the capability, use it. Custom table, modal, drawer, tabs, dropdown, form control, pagination, tooltip, alert, loading, focus, or overlay behavior requires a documented capability gap.
- Raw HTML remains appropriate for semantic content such as headings, paragraphs, articles, labels, and static layout.
- Do not use CSS or native DOM handlers to recreate a library-supported interaction.

## Tab Boundary

- When the affected feature uses tabs, each tab body MUST render one feature-local component. Apply the rule to the installed tab implementation; `nz-tab` examples are conditional on NG-ZORRO being installed.
- The tab parent owns title, permission visibility, selected index, and lazy rendering. The child owns its cohesive surface and exposes typed inputs/outputs.

## Semantic Table Gate

A collection is tabular when users compare multiple records across stable fields. Tabular data MUST use the installed table component or the repository's established semantic table pattern, including inside tabs, drawers, and modals. Do not add NG-ZORRO solely to satisfy this rule.

- Do not emulate rows and columns with `@for` plus `div`, `a`, flex/grid, or `float-right`.
- Timeline, feed, navigation, and genuinely independent cards may remain lists because cross-column comparison is not their purpose.
- Apply [table-standard.md](table-standard.md) after classifying a collection as tabular. Using `nz-table` alone does not prove containment.

## Declarative Templates

- Templates render prepared state and emit user intent. Do not sort, filter, map, reduce, build requests, or perform business calculations in HTML.
- Do not call methods with side effects or non-trivial computation from bindings.
- Move repeated or complex conditions into named `computed()` values, selectors, facade view models, or pure pipes.
- Avoid nested ternaries and duplicated long expressions.
- Use Angular control flow with stable `track` expressions.

## Accessibility

- Use semantic interactive elements, associated labels, keyboard access, visible focus, and accessible names.
- Click behavior on a non-native control requires the equivalent keyboard and focus contract; prefer an installed component or native semantic control.
- Preserve dialog focus behavior, escape/cancel behavior, contrast, and reduced-motion preferences.
